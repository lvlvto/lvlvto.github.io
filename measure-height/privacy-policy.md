This Privacy Policy explains how the developer (“Developer”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use this mobile application (the “App”).

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

The App does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.

The App uses Firebase, a service provided by Google, to collect anonymous analytics and diagnostic data.

This data may include:

app usage statistics,

device information (e.g. device model, operating system version),

anonymized identifiers,

crash reports and performance data,

interaction data (e.g. which features are used).

## How We Use the Information

Collected data is used solely to:

analyze app performance,

identify and fix bugs and crashes,

improve functionality and user experience,

monitor overall app usage trends.

We do not use this data for advertising, marketing, or user profiling.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent user data to third parties.

Data collected via Firebase is processed by Google in accordance with their privacy and security standards and may be stored on servers located outside your country of residence.

## Third-Party Services

The App relies on third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Firebase is operated by Google LLC and is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy.
We recommend reviewing Google’s privacy practices to understand how data is handled.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect collected data. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal data, please contact us so it can be removed.
